### Google Messages Desktop Application ðŸ’¬

This application makes use of Nativefier, a command-line tool for turning web pages into a functional "desktop app".
The generated application is wrapped by Electron and is an executable file usable on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

If like me, you hate having to "alt-tab" to your browser and switching from your computer to your phone to read messages, this is a perfect solution for you!

I configure this application to run "Messages by Google" which is now commonly used by Andriod users. I've configured certain conviences for the app such as minimizing to the taskbar, only allowing one instance, and hardware acceleration.
